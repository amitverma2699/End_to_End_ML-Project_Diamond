# Diamond Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of diamonds based on their features using machine learning techniques. By analyzing key attributes such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and more, we build a predictive model that can estimate a diamond's market value with high accuracy.

## Project Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and relationships in the dataset.
- Data preprocessing including handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical features.
- Machine learning model training using algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
- Deployment-ready pipeline for real-world usage.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about diamonds, including:
- **Carat**: Weight of the diamond
- **Cut**: Quality of the cut (e.g., Ideal, Premium, Good)
- **Color**: Diamond color grade (D to J, where D is the best)
- **Clarity**: Measure of inclusions and blemishes (e.g., IF, VVS1, VVS2)
- **Depth**: Height of a diamond (total depth percentage)
- **Table**: Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point
- **Price**: Price of the diamond (target variable)
- **x, y, z**: Dimensions of the diamond (length, width, and depth)

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diamond-price-prediction.git
   cd diamond-price-prediction
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the dataset and train the model:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Use the provided scripts to train a model and predict diamond prices:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   python predict.py --carat 0.5 --cut Premium --color G --clarity VS2 --depth 61.0 --table 57.0 --x 4.5 --y 4.5 --z 2.8
   ```

## Results
- **Model Accuracy**: The best-performing model achieved an R-squared score of **X.XX**.
- **Feature Importance**: Carat and cut were identified as the most influential features in price prediction.

## Future Work
- Enhance model accuracy by exploring advanced algorithms and feature engineering.
- Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit.
- Integrate with real-time diamond pricing APIs for dynamic predictions.
